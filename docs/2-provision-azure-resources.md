## Deployment Options

You can deploy the application using one of the following options:

- [Azure Developer CLI](#azure-developer-cli)
- [Azure Portal Deployment](#azure-portal-deployment)

### Azure Developer CLI

> **Important**
> This section will create Azure resources and deploy the solution from your local environment using the Azure Developer CLI. Note that you do not need to clone this repo to complete these steps.

1. Download the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)
1. Run `azd init -t microsoft/azurechat`
1. Run `azd up` to provision and deploy the application

### Azure Portal Deployment

> **Warning**
