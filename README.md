# Introduction

_Azure Chat Solution Accelerator powered by Azure Open AI Service_

![](/images/intro.png)

_Azure Chat Solution Accelerator powered by Azure Open AI Service_ is a solution accelerator that allows organisations to deploy a private chat tenant in their Azure Subscription, with a familiar user experience and the added capabilities of chatting over your data and files.

Benefits are:

1. Private: Deployed in your Azure tenancy, allowing you to isolate it to your Azure tenant.

2. Controlled: Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade authentication security features are built in.

3. Value: Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc).
